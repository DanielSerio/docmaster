# Design Guide

The overall feel that we are trying to acheive with our UI is a modern, minimalistic, "OS-like" feel. We should try to maintain tribute to our "tile-like" feel wherever possible.

## General Feel

1. Modern
2. Minimal
3. Playful
4. Professional
5. Compact

## Radius

To maintain a tight, tile-like feel, we will use a reduced border radius. The radius for cards, buttons, badges, etc should feel like squares with dulled corners.

## Spacing

To maintain a compact feel, we will use a reduced spacing.

## Icons

Icons should generally be small, but remain legible. Icons should be used liberally to enhance the UI.
